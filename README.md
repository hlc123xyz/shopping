practice data for pattern analysis

Two hypothetical transactions lists from related shops. Most of the differences or similarities are random noise but there are three things that have been deliberately introduced:

* something about the data
* an easy to find difference between the shop's transaction lists
* a hard to find difference between the shop's transaction lists

Feel free to download the files and go for it.

The format of the file for each line is 

```
"transaction_number", item_number, maybe_another_item_number, etc
```

If you want some names to go with the item numbers:

1. Bread
2. Cheese
3. Lettuce
4. Eggs
5. Apples
6. Oranges
7. Pears
8. Rice
9. Durian

Good Luck.
